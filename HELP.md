## Configuration
While you can use an existing HOOBS user to configure **companion-module-hoobs-api**, we suggest creating a new user for exclusive use with this module with the mininum permissions possible. 

> The HOOBS user used with this module DOES NOT require terminal access.

To configure this module you will need:

1. The IP of your HOOBS instance.
1. The TCP port of your HOOBS instance (usually 80).
1. A set of credentials (username and password) to access your HOOBS instance.
